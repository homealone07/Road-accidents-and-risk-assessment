# Road-accidents-and-risk-assessment

## Introduction
India generally represents pretty much one percent of the worldwide vehicle populace. Be that as it may, it represented around six percent of the absolute worldwide street mishaps. A sum of 4,37,396 street mishap cases were accounted for during 2019. 

## About our project

<li>Firstly, the project combines two important aspects of road safety, i.e., visualizing road accidents and analyzing their risk factors. While both these aspects are commonly studied separately, combining them can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of road safety issues.</li>
<li>Secondly, the project employs advanced technologies such as data visualization tools, machine learning algorithms, and geographic information systems (GIS) to provide an interactive and dynamic platform for analyzing road safety risks. This approach can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the analysis and enable policymakers to make more informed decisions.</li>
<li>Thirdly, the project focuses on the visualization and analysis of road accidents in a specific geographic region, which can help identify localized road safety risks and facilitate targeted interventions. This approach can be particularly useful for developing countries or regions where resources for road safety interventions may be limited.</li>
<li>Overall, the project "road accident visualization and risk analysis" is novel in its approach and has the potential to contribute significantly to improving road safety outcomes.</li>
